# Automatic-Water-Pump-and-Night-Light Combined
Used waterproof sonar sensor to measure the water level by the digital pin of ATmega328P Microcontroller and a self-made light sensor (light depending resistor and potentiometer) to measure the light intensity of light by analog pin; used optoisolated relay switch to automatically turn on/off the 1.5 HP water pump by the microcontroller depending on the water level; used a relay switch along with BC 547 transistor to atomically turn on/off the night light by the microcontroller depending on the outdoor light intensity.</br>
Tools: Programming: C/C++, Hardware: JSN-SR04T Ultrasonic Sensor, LDR, POT, 7805 Voltage Regulator with Heatsink, 9V DC Power Adapter, Atmega328p Microcontroller, 20Ã—4 LCD Module, 9V Relay Switch, BC547 Transistor,  35 amp Opto-Isolated Relay.</br>
